                    <h1>Early life</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p> Lipa was born in London, to Albanian parents from Kosovo who had left Pristina in the 1990s. She
                        attended Sylvia Young Theatre School, part-time, before moving to Kosovo with her family in
                        2008. Lipa grew up listening to her father, singer Dukagjin Lipa. Her given name means "love" in
                        Albanian; its atypical nature was cause for distaste in her youth, but she grew to "enjoy" it as
                        it eliminated the need for a stage name. At the age of 14, she began posting covers of her
                        favorite songs by artists such as P!nk and Nelly Furtado on YouTube. At the age of 15, she moved
                        back to London with aspirations of becoming a singer. Shortly after, she began working as a
                        model. In 2013, she starred in a television advertisement for The X Factor.</p>
