                        <h1>Dua Lipa</h1>
                        <br>
                        <p>Singer-songwriter Dua Lipa is the daughter of Kosovar Albanians who were refugees in London in the 1990s. Her name "Dua" means love in Albanian; she has no middle name. Lipa was so committed to pursuing a career in music that at 15 she went to live in London on her own. (Her family had returned to Kosovo a few years earlier.) She used social media to promote herself before signing with a label. Lipa said her earlier music was "dark pop," but her successful second album Future Nostalgia had more uptempo tunes. Lipa has collaborated with numerous other artists, including Elton John, Miley Cyrus and Chris Martin.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In 2015, Lipa began working on her debut album for Warner Music Group. In August 2015, she
                            released her first single "New Love", produced by Emile Haynie and Andrew Wyatt. She
                            released
                            her second single "Be the One", in October 2015. "Be the One" achieved success across
                            Europe,
                            reaching number one in Belgium, Poland and Slovakia, as well as charting within the top 10
                            in
                            over 11 European territories. In Australia and New Zealand, the song became an airplay
                            success,
                            reaching numbers 6 and 20 respectively. Lipa describes her musical style as "dark pop". On
                            30
                            November 2015, she was revealed as one of the acts on the BBC Sound of...2016 long list. Her
                            first tour in the UK and Europe began in January 2016. In November 2016, Lipa concluded her
                            tour
                            through Europe.

                        <h1>Early life</h1>
                        <br>
                        <p> Lipa was born in London, to Albanian parents from Kosovo who had left Pristina in the 1990s.
                            She
                            attended Sylvia Young Theatre School, part-time, before moving to Kosovo with her family in
                            2008. Lipa grew up listening to her father, singer Dukagjin Lipa. Her given name means
                            "love" in
                            Albanian; its atypical nature was cause for distaste in her youth, but she grew to "enjoy"
                            it as
                            it eliminated the need for a stage name. At the age of 14, she began posting covers of her
                            favorite songs by artists such as P!nk and Nelly Furtado on YouTube. At the age of 15, she
                            moved
                            back to London with aspirations of becoming a singer. Shortly after, she began working as a
                            model. In 2013, she starred in a television advertisement for The X Factor.</p>
